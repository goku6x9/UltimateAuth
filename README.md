# UltimateAuth  
### The Modern Unified Auth Framework for .NET -- Reimagined.
A CodeBeam Project

---

UltimateAuth is an open-source authentication framework that unifies secure session and token based authentication, modern PKCE flows, Blazor/Maui-ready client experiences, and a fully extensible architecture — all with a focus on clarity, lightweight design, and developer happiness.

---

## 🌟 Why UltimateAuth: The Six-Point Principles

### **1) Developer-Centric**
Clean APIs, predictable behavior, minimal ceremony — designed to make authentication *pleasant* for developers.

### **2) Security-Driven**
PKCE, hardened session flows, reuse detection, event-driven safeguards, device awareness, and modern best practices.

### **3) Extensible & Lightweight by Design**
Every component can be replaced or overridden.  
No forced dependencies. No unnecessary weight.

### **4) Plug-and-Play Ready**
From setup to production, UltimateAuth prioritizes a frictionless integration journey with sensible defaults.

### **5) User-Friendly Flows**
Authentication should be secure *and* intuitive.  
Consistent, predictable, and UX-friendly at every step.

### **6) Blazor & MAUI-Ready for Modern .NET**
Blazor WebApp, Blazor WASM, Blazor Server, and .NET MAUI expose weaknesses in traditional auth systems.  
UltimateAuth is engineered from day one to support real-world scenarios across the entire modern .NET UI stack.

## 🔑 What UltimateAuth Provides

- A **secure, modern session-based authentication core**  
  (opaque SessionId, server-managed, real-time revocation, device tracking)

- A **unified architecture** bridging Session, PKCE, and OAuth-style auth flows

- An **override-first design** suitable for enterprise extensions

- A **production-grade client SDK** for Blazor & MAUI

- A **fully interactive sandbox**  
  where developers can test flows, create accounts, simulate devices, and validate behaviors in real time
